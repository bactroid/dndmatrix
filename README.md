# dndmatrix

My friend and co-worker had a peculiar way of generating stat rolls for D&D. He and his friends always rolled 4d6 (drop lowest) 36 times to construct a 6x6 matrix of rolls. Then they could pick one column or one roll to use as their stats array.

This seemed like a fun challenge to stretch my functional programming skills.
